COMMON STEPS INVOLVED IN TRAINING ANN:
--------------------------------------
STEP 1:-
Randomly initiate weights to small number close to zero(but not zero)

STEP 2:-
Input the first observation of your dataset in the input layer, each feature in one input node.

STEP 3:-
Forward - Propagation: From left to right, the neurons are activated in a way that the impact of each neuron's activation limited by the weights. Propagates the activations until getting the predicted result y.

STEP 4:- 
Compare the predicted result to the activated result. Measure generated error.

STEP 5:-
Back - Propagation: from right to left, the error is back-propagated. Update the weights according to how much they are responsible for the error. The learning rate decides by how much we update the weights.

STEP 6:-
When the whole training set passed through the ANN, that makes an epoch. Redo more epochs.
