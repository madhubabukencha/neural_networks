    "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Biological neurons are electrically active cells, and the human brain contains about 10<sup>11</sup> neurons. Each neuron is typically connected to a thousand other neurons and consequently the number of synapses in the brain exceeds 10<sup>14</sup>. Each neuron can be found mainly in 2 states, active or rest. When the neuron is activated, it produces an action potential(electrical impulse) that is transported along the axon. Once the signal reaches the synapse, it causes the release of chemicals that cross the junction and enter the body of other neurons.</div>\n",
