    "       Self Organizing Map (SOM) also know as kohonen maps belongs to the unsupervized area of neural networks. SOM's are invented in 1980's by the professor Teuvo Kohonen. They are primarily used to produce a low-dimensional (typically one or two-dimensional) representation of a higher-dimensional data. SOM also represents clustering concept by grouping similar data together. Therefore it can be said that SOM <b>reduces data dimensions and displays similarities among data</b>.\n",
    "       <br><br>\n",
    "       One of the most interesting aspects of SOMs is that they learn to classify data without supervision. In supervised training techniques such as backpropagation where the training data consists of vector pairs (an input vector and a target vector). With this approach an input vector is presented to the network (typically a multilayer feedforward network) and the output is compared with the target vector. If they differ, the weights of the network are altered slightly to reduce the error in the output. This is repeated many times and with many sets of vector pairs until the network gives the desired output. Training a SOM however, requires no target vector. A SOM learns to classify the training data without any external supervision whatsoever.\n",
    "       <br><br>\n",
    "       The beauty of SOMs is that it preserves the topological relationship of the training dataset (or the input). Implying that the underlying properties of the input data are not affected even after the continuous change in the shape or the size of the figure. SOMs help to reveal correlations that are not easily identified.\n",
