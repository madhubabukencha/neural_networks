    "*   **Weighted Sum:** Each input to a neuron is multiplied by its corresponding weight. These weighted inputs are then summed together. Let's represent this as:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    weighted_sum = (input1 * weight1) + (input2 * weight2) + ... + (inputN * weightN)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Direct Input to Activation Function:** This `weighted_sum` is directly passed to the activation function. There's no additional term added to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The \"Centering\" Effect**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Consider a simple case:** Let's say we have one input (x) and one weight (w). The input to the activation function is simply `x * w`.\n",
    "    *   If `x = 0`, then `x * w = 0`, regardless of the value of `w`.\n",
    "    *   If `w = 0`, then `x * w = 0`, regardless of the value of `x`.\n",
    "*   **Generalizing:** In the case of multiple inputs and weights, if all inputs are zero, the `weighted_sum` will always be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Impact on Activation Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Many common activation functions behave in a specific way around zero:\n",
    "    *   **Sigmoid:** The sigmoid function outputs 0.5 when the input is 0.\n",
    "    *   **Tanh:** The tanh function outputs 0 when the input is 0.\n",
    "    *   **ReLU:** The ReLU function outputs 0 when the input is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Because the `weighted_sum` is directly fed into the activation function, and the `weighted_sum` is zero when all inputs are zero, the output of the activation function is determined by its behavior at zero. This is what we mean by \"centered around the origin.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why is this a limitation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   This means the neuron can only \"activate\" (produce a non-zero output) if there's a non-zero `weighted_sum`. It cannot activate based on a threshold or offset. This limits the types of patterns the network can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** Without a bias term, the neuron's activation is strictly dependent on the weighted sum of its inputs. When all inputs are zero, the activation function is evaluated at zero, effectively centering its behavior around the origin and limiting the neuron's ability to learn diverse patterns."

The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that determines how many times the network will see the entire training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of epochs required to train a neural network depends on a number of factors, including the size of the training dataset, the complexity of the network, and the learning rate. In general, a larger training dataset will require more epochs to train. A more complex network will also require more epochs to train. The learning rate controls how much the weights of the network are updated during each epoch. A higher learning rate will cause the network to learn faster, but it may also lead to overfitting.\n",

A common approach is to start with a small number of epochs and then increase the number of epochs until the performance of the network stops improving.\n",

If we set the number of epochs to 10, then the network will see each training example 10 times during the training process.\n",

If the network is overfitting the training dataset, then increasing the number of epochs will not improve the performance of the network on the test dataset.
